# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) on MS COCO Dataset

This repository demonstrates the implementation of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** using **PyTorch** on the **MS COCO** dataset. The goal of this project is to generate new images that resemble the objects and scenes present in the MS COCO dataset using GANs.

## About the MS COCO Dataset

The **MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context)** dataset is one of the largest and most popular datasets for image recognition, segmentation, and captioning. It contains over 330K images, with annotations for over 80 object categories, keypoints, and captions, making it a valuable resource for training image generation models like GANs.

- **Size**: 330K images
- **Categories**: 80 object categories
- **Annotations**: Object segmentation masks, keypoints, and image captions.

## GAN Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two deep neural networks: a **generator** and a **discriminator**. These two networks are trained together in a zero-sum game, where:

- The **generator** creates fake images that resemble real images from the dataset.
- The **discriminator** attempts to distinguish between real and fake images.

The networks are trained iteratively, improving each other’s performance until the generator produces high-quality, realistic images.

## Project Overview

In this project, we train a GAN on the MS COCO dataset to generate images that look similar to the real images in the dataset. The process includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and preparing the MS COCO dataset for GAN training.
2. **Model Architecture**: Designing the architecture for the Generator and Discriminator networks.
3. **Training**: Training the GAN using the MS COCO images.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the generator by visually inspecting generated images and calculating metrics like Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).
5. **Results**: Displaying the generated images and discussing the quality of the results.

## Dependencies

- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework.
- **TorchVision**: Vision-specific tools for datasets and transformations.
- **Pillow**: Image processing library.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results.

## Model Architecture

### Generator
- **Input**: Random noise vector (`zDim=256`).
- **Layers**:
  - Fully connected layers.
  - Batch normalization.
  - ReLU activations.
- **Output**: Image with shape `(64, 64, 3)`.

### Discriminator
- **Input**: Image (real or fake).
- **Layers**:
  - Fully connected layers.
  - Leaky ReLU activations.
  - Sigmoid output (real or fake probability).

## Training Process

### Data Loading
The images are loaded using a custom `ImageDataset` class, which applies necessary transformations (resize and normalization).

### Model Training
- The **Generator** generates images from random noise.
- The **Discriminator** tries to distinguish between real and fake images.
- The loss is calculated using binary cross-entropy (`BCELoss`).
- The optimizer used is **Adam**, with different learning rates for the generator and discriminator.

### Logging
Real and fake images are logged to TensorBoard every few iterations using `SummaryWriter`.

### Hyperparameters
- `batch_size`: 32
- `num_epochs`: 1000
- Learning rate for discriminator: `1e-5`
- Learning rate for generator: `5e-5`

## Results
Generated images are saved during the training process and visualized using TensorBoard. Below are example steps for inspecting results:

### Example Generated Images
> Example results will be displayed in the **TensorBoard** interface under the "Fake Image" and "Real Image" tags.

## Future Work

### Model Improvements:
- Try advanced architectures like **Progressive GANs** or **StyleGAN** for better image generation.

### Conditioning:
- Implement **Conditional GANs** to generate images based on specific labels or attributes.

### Fine-tuning:
- Fine-tune the model on a specific subset of the MS COCO dataset, such as animal categories or objects in a specific scene.
